# Amazon_Data_Analysis

The "Amazon Data Analysis" project is a comprehensive exploration of data related to Amazon, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into Amazon's business operations, customer behavior, and product trends.

## Data
The data used for this analysis was collected from Kaggle. The data includes information on products, customer reviews, sales figures, ratings, etc.

### Data Preprocessing:
Before analysis, extensive data preprocessing was performed. This included cleaning the data to remove duplicates and missing values, converting data types where necessary, and aggregating data at an appropriate granularity. 


## Analysis
The analysis involved a combination of descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning techniques. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize key metrics, while data visualization helped in presenting trends and patterns.


## Results

Correlation between actual price and discount price of product
Products with rating with 5.0
Lowest rated products
Total number of products in each category
